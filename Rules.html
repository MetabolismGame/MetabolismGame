  <h1>THE METABOLISM GAME</h1>
    <p>THE METABOLISM GAME is an enjoyable way for biology students to learn the
       basic pathways and principles of the cell's energy metabolism. Each player
       represents a living cell faced with the problem of acquiring energy from
       carbon compounds in a convienent, usable form -- the ATP molecule. Players
       move tokens representing carbon atoms through various enzymatic reations,
       generating ATP as they go. </p>
