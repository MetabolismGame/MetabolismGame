  <h1>THE METABOLISM GAME</h1>
    <p>THE METABOLISM GAME is an enjoyable way for biology students to learn the <br />
       basic pathways and principles of the cell's energy metabolism. Each player <br />
       represents a living cell faced with the problem of acquiring energy from <br />
       carbon compounds in a convienent, usable form -- the ATP molecule. Players <br />
       move tokens representing carbon atoms through various enzymatic reations, <br />
       generating ATP as they go. </p>
  <h2>Object</h2>
    <p>   The object of the game is to generate as much ATP as possible. The <br />
        winner may be the first player to accumulate an agreed-upon number of ATP <br />
        molecules (40 is a reasonable goal). If you prefer, ther winner may be the <br />
        player with the most ATP at a fixed time period. </p>
  <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p> THE GAME BOARD. Shows the pathways and enzymes of glycolysis (color-coded <br />
        blue) and the Krebs cycle (color-coded yellow).<br />
    ENZYME CARDS. A deck of 70 cards, including three of each of 22 different <br />
    enzymes, and four wild enzyme cards. <br />
    OXYGEN CARDS. Eight. <br />
    PLAYING TOKENS. Four sets of 18 tokens which represent carbon atoms. <br />
    ATP CURRENCY. Twenty each of three denominations, representing one, three, <br />
    and ten ATP molecules. <br />
    NADH+H- TOKENS. Ten. <br />
    FADH2 TOKENS. Ten. <br /></p>
